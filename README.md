## Timeline
### 5/9/20

### 5/21/20 
Started actual project, but I'm having issues connecting and pushing to Github. I think its because I'm trying to use both the Qt interface and the terminal. The error has something to do with creating an index.lock file.

### 5/29/20 
I did a lot of research on how to use Qt to make this, but couldn't find anything really clear, so I decided to just code this on Xcode using SFML for MacOS.
    Configuring SFML for my Mac took me 3 hours because there were so many errors.
    
### 6/2/20 
Started following the tutorial for the code, but the sizes of my images don't match the ones he has.

### 6/5/20 
Doodler can now be controlled by keyboard and move up when it collides with platforms.
<br> - Fixed the sizes of the images by using the images from the tutorial instead of my own. I think it's because my images originally were the wrong dimensions. My doodler originally jumped way too fast, but I realized I didn't set the Frameratelimit.
<br> - Also figuring out how to use markdown
