For my final project, I would like to make a doodle jump game.

Basic Idea:

Have platforms occuring at regular intervals along the y-axis but at random places along the x-axis.
When game starts, character will start jumping.
Use arrow keys to move character left and right.
Character keeps jumping upwards from platform to platform until it misses a platform and dies.
